# **Definitions**

**Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):** Privately owned wireless and/or portable electronic handheld equipment.

# **Overview**

Acceptable use of BYOD at {COMPANY-NAME} must be managed to ensure that access to {COMPANY-NAME}’s resources for business are performed in a safe and secure manner for participants of the {COMPANY-NAME} BYOD program. A participant of the BYOD program includes, but is not limited to:

- Employees
- Contractors
- Board of Directors
- Volunteers
- Related constituents who participate in the BYOD program

This policy is designed to maximize the degree to which private and confidential data is protected from both deliberate and inadvertent exposure and/or breach.

**Purpose**

This policy defines the standards, procedures, and restrictions for end users who have legitimate business requirements to access corporate data using their personal device. This policy applies to, but is not limited to, any mobile devices owned by any users listed above participating in the {COMPANY-NAME} BYOD program which contains stored data owned by {COMPANY-NAME}, and all devices and accompanying media that fit the following device classifications:

- Laptops. Notebooks, and hybrid devices
- Tablets
- Mobile/cellular phones including smartphones
- Any non-{COMPANY-NAME} owned mobile device capable of storing corporate data and connecting to an unmanaged network

Refer to the Company and Personally Owned Mobile Device Procedure.

This policy addresses a range of threats to, or related to, the use of {COMPANY-NAME} data:

| **Threat** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Loss | Devices used to transfer, or transport work files could be lost or stolen |
| Theft | Sensitive corporate data is deliberately stolen and sold by an employee |
| Copyright | Software copied onto a mobile device could violate licensing |
| Malware | Virus, Trojans, Worms, Spyware and other threats could be introduced via a mobile device |
| Compliance | Loss or theft of financial and/or personal and confidential data could expose {COMPANY-NAME} to the risk of non-compliance with various identity theft and privacy laws |

Addition of new hardware, software, and/or related components to provide additional mobile device connectivity will be managed at the sole discretion of IT. Non-sanctioned use of mobile devices to backup, store, and otherwise access any enterprise-related data is strictly forbidden.

This policy is complementary to any other implemented policies dealing specifically with data access, data storage, data movement, and connectivity of mobile devices to any element of the {COMPANY-NAME} network.

**Audience**

This policy applies to all {COMPANY-NAME} employees, including full and part-time staff, Board of Directors, volunteers, contractors, freelancers, and other agents who utilize personally-owned mobile devices to access, store, back up, relocate, or access any organization or member-specific data. Such access to this confidential data is a privilege, not a right, and forms the basis of the trust {COMPANY-NAME} has built with its members, suppliers, and other constituents. Consequently, employment at {COMPANY-NAME} does not automatically guarantee the initial and ongoing ability to use these devices to gain access to corporate networks and information.

## **Policy Detail**

This policy applies to:

- Any privately owned wireless and/or portable electronic handheld equipment, hereby referred to as BYOD. {COMPANY-NAME} grants potential participants of the BYOD program the privilege of purchasing and using a device of their choosing at work for their convenience.
- Related software that could be used to access corporate resources.

This policy is intended to protect the security and integrity of {COMPANY-NAME}’s data and technology infrastructure. Limited exceptions to the policy may occur due to variations in devices and platforms.

The Audience, as defined above, must agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy to be able to connect their devices to the company network. If users do not abide by this policy, {COMPANY-NAME} reserves the right to revoke this privilege.

The following criteria will be considered initially, and on a continuing basis, to determine if the Audience is eligible to connect a personal smart device to the {COMPANY-NAME} network.

- Sensitivity of data the Audience can access
- Legislation or regulations prohibiting or limiting the use of a personal smart device for {COMPANY-NAME} business

- IT reserves the right to refuse, by non-physical means, the ability to connect mobile devices to {COMPANY-NAME} and {COMPANY-NAME}-connected infrastructure. IT will engage in such action if it feels such equipment is being used in such a way that puts {COMPANY-NAME}’s systems, data, users, and members at risk.
- IT will maintain a list of approved mobile devices and related software applications and utilities. Devices that are not on this list may not be connected to the {COMPANY-NAME} infrastructure. To find out if a preferred device is on this list, an individual should contact the {COMPANY-NAME} IT department Service Desk. Although IT currently allows only listed devices to be connected to the {COMPANY-NAME} infrastructure, IT reserves the right to update this list in the future.
- IT will maintain enterprise IT security standards.
- IT will inspect all mobile devices attempting to connect to the {COMPANY-NAME} network through an unmanaged network (i.e. the Internet) using technology centrally managed by the IT Department.

  - Use secure data management procedures. All BYOD equipment, containing stored data owned by {COMPANY-NAME}, must use an approved method of encryption during transmission to protect data.
  - Be expected to adhere to the same security protocols when connected with approved BYOD equipment to protect {COMPANY-NAME}’s infrastructure.
- {COMPANY-NAME} data is not to be accessed on any hardware that fails to meet {COMPANY-NAME}’s established enterprise IT security standards.

Anti-virus signature files must be up to date on any additional client machines – such as a home PC – on which this media will be accessed.
  - IT can and will establish audit trails and these will be accessed, published, and used without notice. Such trails will be able to track the attachment of an external device to a PC, and the resulting reports may be used for investigation of possible breaches and/or misuse.
  - If A) any BYOD device is lost or stolen, immediately contact {COMPANY-NAME} IT; and, if B) any BYOD device is scheduled to be upgraded or exchanged, the user must contact IT in advance. IT will disable the BYOD and delete associated company data. /R
  - BYOD equipment that is used to conduct {COMPANY-NAME} business will be utilized appropriately, responsibly, and ethically. Failure to do so will result in immediate suspension of that user’s access.
  - Any attempt to contravene or bypass said security implementation will be deemed an intrusion attempt and will be dealt with in accordance with {COMPANY-NAME}’s overarching security policy.
  - Usage of location-based services and mobile check-in services, which leverage device GPS capabilities to share real-time user location with external parties, is prohibited within the workplace.
  - The user agrees to and accepts that his or her access and/or connection to {COMPANY-NAME}’s networks may be monitored to record dates, times, duration of access, etc. This is done to identify unusual usage patterns or other suspicious activity, and to identify accounts/computers that may have been compromised by external parties. In all cases, data protection remains {COMPANY-NAME}’s highest priority.
