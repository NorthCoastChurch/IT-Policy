# **Introduction**

North Coast Church is committed to full compliance with applicable laws related to the use of artificial intelligence in the countries in which North Coast Church provides products and services. Additionally, North Coast Church is committed to the ethical use of artificial intelligence. This Artificial Intelligence Use Policy (“Policy”) outlines North Coast Church’s requirements with respect to the adoption of all forms of artificial intelligence at North Coast Church. Such artificial intelligence adoption includes use for business efficiencies, operations, and inclusion in North Coast Church’s products and services.

This Policy is applicable to all North Coast Church directors, officers, employees, volunteers, contractors, representatives, affiliates, agents, and any person or entity performing services for or on behalf of North Coast Church.

# **Overview**

The intent of this Policy is to provide general guidance on the use of AI at North Coast Church so that North Coast Church can leverage the use of AI as a tool while ensuring it continues to meet legal obligations and act in an ethical manner. The use of AI at North Coast Church should never compromise North Coast Church’s core values or introduce undue risk to the organization. Rather, the use of AI at North Coast Church should be focused on improving its efficiencies and enhancing North Coast Church’s ability to fulfill its mission.

This Policy provides overarching guidance based on global standards for the use of AI. North Coast Church Representatives should be cognizant when using AI at North Coast Church that they think about the global impact of their decision to use AI, as the use of AI in some countries may not be permitted in others.

This Policy is not intended to address every use of AI at North Coast Church by a North Coast Church Representative. There are certain business departments and functions at North Coast Church that bear more considerations and potential risks. Before using any AI at North Coast Church—whether for personal business tasks such as writing an email or more complex business processes such as analyzing datasets - you should consult with your manager and seek guidance. Also, please see Prohibited Uses in Section 4 below for situations in which AI may not be used at North Coast Church, and High-Risk Use of AI Systems below for situations in which extreme caution is required when considering using AI.

In addition, there are certain Embedded AI Tools used in existing approved North Coast Church software that do not require additional approval for use. For example, the use of Microsoft Word in which Microsoft Word has embedded an AI tool to check spelling or grammar. The use of Embedded AI Tools in approved software at North Coast Church is permitted, provided those software tools are aligned with previous general business uses and have been approved for use by the IT Department.

When third-party software, services, or contractors are utilized or employed, any AI usage by software used by these parties or services must be noted and evaluated carefully. Contracted services that utilize AI technology should be considered in the same light as individual AI usage. Consult with the IT Department about the inclusion of an AI-specific clause in any vendor or contractor agreements.

The following principles must be followed when considering using an AI system at North Coast Church:

- The use of an AI system should primarily focus on completing departmental goals as directed by leadership. Except for the use of an Embedded AI Tool in a software system approved for use at North Coast Church, any use of a new AI System at North Coast Church must be approved by the IT Department. See General AI Use Standards and Use Approval in Section 4 below.
- Individuals using an AI system must have expertise in the subject matter for which the AI is used. AI is to be utilized as a tool and is not a substitute for expertise. For example, if using AI for coding, the individual deploying the AI must have expertise in coding.
- All AI-generated content (writing, datasets, graphs, pictures, etc.) must be thoroughly reviewed by an individual with expertise to evaluate such content for accuracy as well as general proofing and editing. AI-generated content should be viewed as a starting point, not the finished product. Like any content at North Coast Church, AI-generated content should conform to the look and feel of the North Coast Church brand and voice.
- Any use of an AI system must have clear objectives for the AI use as a tool and business-accepted data sets from which the AI draws. If the data sets that the AI is using are not accurate, then the information AI provides will not be accurate.
- AI systems are trained on data that may contain inherent bias. Users of these systems are responsible for reviewing any AI-produced content for bias and correcting it as necessary.
- Non-public North Coast Church information must never be put into an open AI system.
- North Coast Church Representatives must document all AI systems they are utilizing and for what functions. Tracking the use of AI is not optional and is part of your job. Documentation of specific AI Embedded Tools in an approved existing software tool when using that tool as intended is not required. Discuss the process for tracking the use of AI systems with your department head.
- The use of an AI system must be documented to capture institutional knowledge. For example, if AI is used to create code and included in a larger section of code, there must be documentation as to which code section is AI-derived and who reviewed it.
- The use of an AI system must meet any terms of use or contractual limitations. Contractual restrictions or terms of use may restrict North Coast Church’s use of an AI system that would otherwise be legally compliant and ethically sound. For example, an AI system’s terms of use may require the use of certain disclaimers in certain use situations or prohibit the use of the AI system to do certain tasks. North Coast Church Representatives should have all terms or use or contracts for AI systems reviewed by the IT Department to ensure compliance with contractual obligations in using an AI system.
- Approval of an AI system does not eliminate the need for other internal approvals required at North Coast Church for the use of technology, such as a security review, privacy review, cost review and spend approval, legal review, human resources review, etc. An AI system should go through the same review and approval process as other software or services at North Coast Church. You should also ensure within your business unit that your business leader is aware of the use of the AI system and has approved any use of the AI system, particularly for AI-generated content that will be relayed externally.

# **1. Prohibited Uses**

There are certain uses of AI that are prohibited. Unless otherwise approved by the IT Department, North Coast Church Representatives are prohibited from using AI systems for any of the following activities at any time:

- Conducting political lobbying activities is prohibited. Lobbying is defined as any action aimed at influencing a Government, Government Official, or Government Entity for any reason.
- Using AI systems to identify or categorize students, candidates, employees, contractors, volunteers, or other affiliated entities based on protected class status is prohibited.
- Entering trade secrets, confidential information, or personal data about any individual into an open AI system.
- Entering any sensitive information about an individual into any AI system. “Sensitive information” includes medical, financial, political affiliation, racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or any other part of a person’s life someone would want to keep private.
- Using an AI system to obtain legal advice, including, but not limited to, creating policies for internal use or to provide to third parties.
- Creating intellectual property that North Coast Church desires to register and/or holds significant value to the organization.

# **2. Ethical Guidelines**

North Coast Church desires to act in an ethical manner when using AI. Accordingly, there may be uses of AI that are legally permissible but which do not meet ethical requirements. Any use of an AI system at North Coast Church should conform to the following ethical guidelines:

- **Informed Consent:**: Prior to inputting personal information into a closed AI system, ensure that you have obtained informed consent from the individual(s) whose personal information will be inputted.
- **Integrity in Use**: All users of AI systems should be honest about how AI helped in getting the work done. Even if using an AI system approved by the IT Department for an approved use, you should ensure your manager or the department requesting a task for which you are using an AI system is aware of your use of the AI system. Do not pass off AI-generated work as done by you solely. Additionally, you should ask permission if you desire to use an AI system tool to complete a task. For example, you should ask your manager and HR representative if you may use an AI system to assist in writing a performance evaluation.
- **Appropriate Content**: Do not use company time or resources to generate content using an AI system that would be considered illegal, inappropriate, harmful to North Coast Church’s brand or reputation, or disrespectful to others.
- **Unauthorized Use:** Do not use company time or resources to generate content using an AI system for personal use without prior approval of the appropriate department leader.

# **3. High-Risk Use of AI Systems**

There are certain uses of AI systems that are more high risk than others. As a global company, North Coast Church is committed to complying with all AI legal requirements and guidance in the countries in which it operates. The European Union (“EU”) has classified the following potential uses of AI as posing a high risk to the health and safety or fundamental rights of natural persons. Therefore, there are several additional requirements for the use of AI systems in such cases. These requirements are listed in Appendix II, with certain functions highlighted below:

- **Personal Data in AI Systems:** AI should be used with extreme caution when inputting any personal data of an individual into a closed AI system (it is prohibited to put any personal data into an open AI system).
- **Screening Job Candidates:** AI should be used with caution when screening any job applicants to ensure it does not adversely impact protected class members or introduce any bias. Equity and inclusion issues surrounding AI use in job screening are a potential source of litigation.
- **Personnel Decisions:** AI should be used with caution for any use related to making decisions on promotions, retention, or similar personnel such decisions. Extreme caution should be utilized to ensure that biases (including biases found in existing data sets) are avoided.
- **Enrollment** **Decisions:** Extreme caution should be utilized if using AI in any manner related to evaluating potential candidates for admission into a voluenteer posistion, internship, or any other North Coast Church function.
- **Assessment of Students:** Any assessment of students in educational or vocational training institutions is considered high risk. Accordingly, extreme caution should be utilized before using any AI system intended to assess or evaluate any student participating in a course, taking an exam, or other evaluation or assessment.

# **4. General AI System Use Standards and Use Approval**

Except for AI Embedded Tools in approved software, all uses of AI systems must be approved by the IT Department prior to use to ensure such AI system use meets the following principles:

- **Lawful:** The use of AI systems must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any contractual obligations, limitations, or restrictions.
- **Ethical:** The use of AI systems must adhere to ethical principles, be fair, and avoid bias.
- **Transparent:** There must be clear objectives for the use of an AI system and documented oversight of such use, which is recorded and captured for institutional knowledge. Disclosures of the use of AI in any AI-assisted content generation must be made when required by law or contract, or when required by the North Coast Church.
- **Necessary:** The use of AI systems must be for a valid business purpose to improve North Coast Church’s business efficiencies and support the organization’s mission. The use of AI is not a substitute for human critical thinking or expertise and should not require North Coast Church to incur an unnecessary expense without any true benefit.

Prior to submitting a request to the IT Department for the use of an AI system, a requester should first obtain the approval of his or her manager. In addition, in evaluating whether to make a request, the requester should ensure that the AI system use, if approved, would conform with the guidelines in this Policy, prior to submitting such request.

# **5. Training**

All North Coast Church Representatives who interact with AI systems must be trained on this Policy. Additionally, specific departments or functions at North Coast Church may require more specific training on the use of AI systems for their department or function when more high-risk.

# **6. Reporting Non-Compliance**

North Coast Church directors, managers, employees, and agents aware of any conduct that may violate this Policy have a responsibility to report it. Individuals are encouraged to make reports through normal reporting relationships beginning with their manager. All reports of suspected misconduct or non-compliance will be investigated by the IT Department, Legal Counsel, Human Resources, or other appropriate parties. Unless acting in bad faith, North Coast Church employees will not be subject to reprisals for reporting potential violations.

If North Coast Church determines that a North Coast Church Representative has failed to comply with this Policy after an investigation concludes, then the North Coast Church Representative will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
