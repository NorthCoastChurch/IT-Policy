# **Definitions**

**Telecommuting:** A work arrangement in which employees do not commute or travel by bus or car to a central place of work, such as an office building, warehouse, or store. Telecommuters often maintain a specific office or workspace and usually work from this alternative work site during predefined days of the week. This is differentiated from teleworking or working remotely, that may refer to casual or occasional remote work done by a traditional employee while away from their traditional company office.

# **Overview**

Telecommuting allows employees to work at home. Telecommuting is a voluntary work alternative that may be appropriate for some employees and some jobs.

**Purpose**

For the purposes of this policy, reference is made to the defined telecommuting employee who regularly performs their work from an office that is not within a North Coast Church building or suite. Casual telework by employees or remote work by non- employees is not included herein. Focusing on the IT equipment typically provided to a telecommuter, this policy addresses the telecommuting work arrangement and the responsibility for the equipment provided by North Coast Church.

## **Policy Detail**

Telecommuting arrangements are made on a case-by-case basis, focusing first on the business needs of the organization.

The company may provide specific equipment for the employee to perform his/her current duties. This may include computer hardware, computer software, mobile phone, email, voicemail, connectivity to host applications, and other applicable equipment as deemed necessary. In order to purchase, configure, ship, and install the required equipment to the remote location, the IT Department shall be notified in advance of the telecommuting start date.

The use of equipment, software, and data supplies, when provided by North Coast Church for use at the remote work location, is limited to authorized persons and for purposes relating to North Coast Church business. North Coast Church will provide for repairs to or replacement of provided equipment. Damage to equipment owned by North Coast Church, that is outside the employee’s control, will be covered by the organization’s insurance policy. In the event of such damage, loaner equipment may be provided when available and must be returned upon request.

The IT Department will be responsible for all equipment installation, maintenance, security access, support, and necessary training related to North Coast Church equipment and software at the remote site, even in the event IT chooses to outsource services. All provided, qualified equipment will be tracked in the IT asset program.

The employee shall designate a workspace, within the remote work location, for placement and installation of equipment to be used while teleworking. The employee shall maintain this workspace in a safe condition, free from hazards and other dangers to the employee and equipment. All North Coast Church materials should be kept in the designated work area at home and not made accessible to others. All applicable policies for acceptable use, protection of member information, security, reimbursement of

business voice and Internet charges, etc., shall be observed. Personally owned equipment may not be connected to North Coast Church owned equipment.

The employee must sign the Telecommuting Equipment Agreement document and the Telecommuting Equipment document for all North Coast Church owned property provided to the employee for telecommuting purposes (see Exhibits A and B). When the employee ceases to telecommute or is terminated, all North Coast Church owned equipment shall be returned to the IT Department within five (5) business days.
