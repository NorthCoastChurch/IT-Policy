## **Policy Detail**

All hardware, software, or components purchased with North Coast Church funds are the property of North Coast Church. This also includes all items purchased using a personal credit card, for which the employee is later reimbursed.

All purchase requests for hardware, software, computer-related components, internet services, or third-party electronic services must be submitted to the IT Department, via the Service Desk, for final purchase approval. If the requested item is already in inventory, then it will be made available to the requestor, assuming that it meets organizational unit goals.

**For purchases within IT**

A procurement procedure is maintained by the VP of IT. Purchasing within the IT Department falls under four general categories.

- **Standard Items**
  - Purchase of items, which have been pre-approved by IT management, that require only a Service Desk request.
  - The standard items list, located in the IT procedure documentation, contains preapproved vendors and products which North Coast Church has standardized. Standard items have been proven to be both supportable by the IT Department, as well as cost effective.
- **Non-Standard Items**
  - Purchase of non-standard items/services, which are not classified as capital expenses, such as non-standard hardware/software that is expensed or contracted services.
  - Non-standard purchases should be minimized as much as reasonably possible. Requests for non-standard items will go through a formal selection process that will involve thorough vendor sourcing. IT will review non-standard purchases for viability of support and compatibility.
  - The selection process may vary depending on the type, cost, and other purchase significance factors. Before approval will be granted, employees or departments requesting non-emergency specialized software, or components, must submit a plan detailing how this item will be supported. Support options include assigning a staff member to maintain and/or support the component, arranging for external vendor support, or arranging for a service-level agreement with the IT Department.
  - Individuals requesting non-standard items for purchase can suggest a potential vendor, if a pre-existing relationship exists between that vendor and North Coast Church.
- **Capital Expenses**
  - Purchase of non-standard capitalized hardware, software, or equipment.
  - Capitalized expenditures, defined as hardware, software, or equipment above $2,500.00 or as specified in the North Coast Church Fixed Asset Policy, which are capitalized by North Coast Church, must go through the CFO and CEO for approval. These purchases may only be requisitioned by department managers. The purchase selection process for these expenditures will be evaluated by Senior Management.
- **Employee Purchasing**
  - Items that do not require any purchase approval.

**System replacement**

Major technology purchases are approved through the budgetary process. Equipment replaced during the course of any period shall be based on a minimum annual review of the asset management program and hardware replenishment schedule, hardware inventory, and fixed asset budget schedules.

**Asset Management Program**

Certain classes of North Coast Church assets, as defined below (“Qualified Assets” or “Asset”), procured or curated by the North Coast Church Information Technology department shall be duly managed with the objective of protecting them from misappropriation and unplanned obsolescence. Methods shall be devised and followed to allow for asset identification, assignment, tracking, lifecycle management, reporting, and disposition.

Included asset classes are as follows: Technology equipment, computer hardware, peripherals, and other items purchased by North Coast Church IT or managed by same that are

- semi-permanent in their end-user assignment (example: specific person, department) or purpose (example: loaner laptop, projector) AND
