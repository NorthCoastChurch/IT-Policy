# **Overview**

Hardware and electronic media disposition is necessary at North Coast Church to ensure the proper disposition of all non-leased North Coast Church IT hardware and media capable of storing member information. Improper disposition can lead to potentially devastating fines and lawsuits, as well as possible irreparable brand damage.

**Purpose**

North Coast Church owned surplus hardware, obsolete machines, and any equipment beyond reasonable repair or reuse, including media, are covered by this policy.

Where assets have not reached end of life, it is desirable to take advantage of residual value through reselling, auctioning, donating, or reassignment to a less critical function. This policy will establish and define standards, procedures, and restrictions for the disposition of non-leased IT equipment and media in a legal, cost-effective manner.

North Coast Church’s surplus or obsolete IT assets and resources (i.e. desktop computers, servers, etc.) must be discarded according to legal requirements and environmental regulations through the appropriate external agents and North Coast Church’s upgrade guidelines.

All disposition procedures for retired IT assets must adhere to company approved methods.

# **Policy Detail**

coordinated by North Coast Church’s IT Department. The IT Department is responsible for backing up data from IT assets slated for disposition (if applicable) and removing company tags and/or identifying labels. IT is responsible for selecting and approving external agents for hardware sanitization, reselling, recycling, or destruction of the equipment. IT is also responsible for the chain of custody in acquiring credible documentation from contracted third parties that verify adequate disposition and disposal that adhere to legal requirements and environmental regulations.

It is the responsibility of any employee of North Coast Church’s IT Department, with the appropriate authority, to ensure that IT assets are disposed of according to the methods in the Hardware and Electronic Media Disposal Procedure. It is imperative that all dispositions are done appropriately, responsibly, and according to IT lifecycle standards, as well as with North Coast Church’s resource planning in mind.
