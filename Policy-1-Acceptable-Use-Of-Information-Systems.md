# **Overview**

Data, electronic file content, information systems, and computer systems at North Coast Church must be managed as valuable organization resources.

Information Technology’s (IT) intentions are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to North Coast Church’s established culture of openness, trust, and integrity. IT is committed to protecting North Coast Church’s authorized users, partners, and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including, but not limited to, computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, instant messaging, web browsing, and file sharing are the property of North Coast Church.

These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of North Coast Church and of its clients and members during normal operations.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every North Coast Church employee, volunteer, and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems.

It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines and to conduct activities accordingly.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at North Coast Church. These rules are in place to protect the authorized user and North Coast Church.
