# **Definitions**

**File Transfer Protocol (FTP):** Is a standard Internet protocol for transmitting files between computers on the Internet.

# **Overview**

The servers at North Coast Church provide a wide variety of services to internal and external users, and many servers also store or process sensitive information for North Coast Church. These hardware devices are vulnerable to attacks from outside sources which require due diligence by the IT Department to secure the hardware against such attacks.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to define standards and restrictions for the base configuration of internal server equipment owned and/or operated by or on North Coast Church’s internal network(s) or related technology resources via any means. This can include, but is not limited to, the following:

- Internet servers (FTP servers, Web servers, Mail servers, Proxy servers, etc.)
- Application servers
- Database servers
- File servers
- Print servers
- Third-party appliances that manage network resources

This policy also covers any server device outsourced, co-located, or hosted at external/third-party service providers, if that equipment resides in the North Coast Church.org domain or appears to be owned by North Coast Church.

The overriding goal of this policy is to reduce operating risk. Adherence to the North Coast Church Server Security Policy will:

- Eliminate configuration errors and reduce server outages
- Reduce undocumented server configuration changes that tend to open up security vulnerabilities
- Facilitate compliance and demonstrate that the controls are working
- Protect North Coast Church data, networks, and databases from unauthorized use and/or malicious attack

Therefore, all server equipment that is owned and/or operated by North Coast Church must be provisioned and operated in a manner that adheres to company defined processes for doing so.

This policy applies to all North Coast Church company-owned, company operated, or company controlled server equipment. Addition of new servers, within North Coast Church facilities, will be managed at the sole discretion of IT. Non-sanctioned server installations, or use of unauthorized equipment that manage networked resources on North Coast Church property, is strictly forbidden.

## **Policy Detail**

**Responsibilities**

North Coast Church’s VP of IT has the overall responsibility for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of North Coast Church data.

Other IT staff members, under the direction of the Director of IT, are responsible for following the procedures and policies within IT.

**Supported Technology**

All servers will be centrally managed by North Coast Church’s IT Department and will utilize approved server configuration standards. Approved server configuration standards will be established and maintained by North Coast Church’s IT Department.

All established standards and guidelines for the North Coast Church IT environment are documented in an IT storage location.

- The following outlines North Coast Church’s minimum system requirements for server equipment supporting North Coast Church’s systems.
- Operating System (OS) configuration must be in accordance with approved procedures.
- Unused services and applications must be disabled, except where approved by the Director of IT or the VP of IT.
- Access to services must be logged or protected though appropriate access control methods.
- Security patches must be installed on the system as soon as possible through
- North Coast Church’s configuration management processes.
- Trust relationships allow users and computers to be authenticated (to have their identity verified) by an authentication authority. Trust relationships should be evaluated for their inherent security risk before implementation.
- Authorized users must always use the standard security principle of “Least Required Access” to perform a function.
- System administration and other privileged access must be performed through a secure connection. Root is a user account that has administrative
- privileges which allows access to any file or folder on the system. Do not use the root account when a non-privileged account will do.
- All North Coast Church servers are to be in access-controlled environments.
- All employees are specifically prohibited from operating servers in environments with uncontrolled access (i.e. offices).

This policy is complementary to any previously implemented policies dealing specifically with security and network access to North Coast Church’s network.

It is the responsibility of any employee of North Coast Church who is installing or operating server equipment to protect North Coast Church’s technology based resources (such as North Coast Church data, computer systems, networks, databases, etc.) from unauthorized use and/or malicious attack that could result in the loss of member information, damage to critical applications, loss of revenue, and damage to North Coast Church’s public image. Procedures will be followed to ensure resources are protected.
