# Email and Messaging Systems

# **Definitions**

**Electronic mail (e-mail)**: Any message, image, form, attachment, data, or other communication sent, received, or stored within an electronic mail system. For the purpose of this policy instant messaging, text messaging, and other forms of electronic communication are also considered electronic mail.

**Anti-Spoofing**: A technique for identifying and dropping units of data, called packets, that have a false source address.

**Antivirus**: Software used to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software.

**Electronic mail system**: Any computer software application that allows electronic mail to be communicated from one computing system to another.

**Email spoofing:** The forgery of an email header so the message appears to have originated from someone other than the actual source.

**Inbound filters:** A type of software based traffic filter allowing only designated traffic to flow towards a network.

**Quarantine:** Suspicious email message may be identified by an antivirus filter and isolated from the normal mail inbox.

**SPAM:** Unsolicited e-mail, usually from Internet sources. It is often referred to as junk e- mail.

# **Overview**

E-mail at North Coast Church must be managed as valuable and mission critical resources. Thus, this policy is established to:

- Create prudent and acceptable practices regarding the use of information resources
- Educate individuals who may use information resources with respect to their responsibilities associated with such use
- Establish a schedule for retaining and archiving e-mail

**Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to establish rules for the use of North Coast Church email for sending, receiving, or storing of electronic mail. All use of email must be consistent with North Coast Church policies and procedures of ethical conduct, safety, compliance with applicable laws, and proper business practices.

**Audience**

This policy applies equally to all individuals granted access privileges to any North Coast Church information resource with the capacity to send, receive, or store electronic mail.

**Legal**

Individuals involved may be held liable for:

- Sending or forwarding e-mails with any libelous, defamatory, offensive, racist, or obscene remarks
- Sending or forwarding confidential information without permission
- Sending or forwarding copyrighted material without permission
- Knowingly sending or forwarding an attachment that contains a virus

**Policy Detail**

Corporate e-mail is not private. Users expressly waive any right of privacy in anything they create, store, send, or receive on North Coast Church’s computer systems. North Coast Church can, but is not obliged to, monitor emails without prior notification. All e-mails, files, and documents – including personal e-mails, files, and documents – are owned by North Coast Church, may be subject to open records requests, and may be accessed in accordance with this policy.

Incoming email must be treated with the utmost care due to the inherent information security risks. An anti-virus application is used to identify malicious code(s) or files. All email is subjected to inbound filtering of e-mail attachments to scan for viruses, malicious code, or spam. Spam will be quarantined for the user to review for relevancy. Introducing a virus or malicious code to North Coast Church systems could wreak havoc on the ability to conduct business. If the automatic scanning detects a security risk, IT must be immediately notified.

Anti-spoofing practices have been initiated for detecting spoofed emails. Employees should be diligent in identifying a spoofed email. If email spoofing has occurred, IT must be immediately notified.

Incoming emails are scanned for malicious file attachments. If an attachment is identified as having an extension known to be associated with malware, or prone to abuse by malware or bad actors or otherwise poses heightened risk, the attachment will be removed from the email prior to delivery. Email rejection is achieved through listing domains and IP addresses associated with malicious actors along with other threat sensing technologies. Any incoming email originating from a known malicious actor will not be delivered. Any email account misbehaving by sending out spam will be shut down. A review of the account will be performed to determine the cause of the actions.

E-mail is to be used for business purposes only and in a manner that is consistent with other forms of professional business communication. All outgoing attachments are automatically scanned for virus and malicious code. The transmission of a harmful attachment can not only cause damage to the recipient’s system, but also harm North Coast Church’s reputation. The following activities are prohibited by policy:

- Users are prohibited from automatically forwarding or integrating email to third-party clients, applications or systems. Individual messages which are forwarded intentionally must not contain confidential or sensitive information.
- Users are prohibited from using third-party email systems and storage servers such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, iCloud, etc. to conduct North Coast Church business, to create or memorialize any binding transactions, or to store or retain email on behalf of North Coast Church.
- Sending e-mail that may be deemed intimidating, harassing, or offensive. This includes, but is not limited to: abusive language, politics/political beliefs, sexually explicit remarks or pictures, profanities, defamatory or discriminatory remarks regarding race, creed, color, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. Employees who receive any emails with this content from any North Coast Church employee should report the matter to their supervisor immediately.
- Using e-mail for conducting personal business.
- Sending unsolicited email messages, including sending "junk mail" or other advertising material to individuals who did not specifically request such material (email spam).
