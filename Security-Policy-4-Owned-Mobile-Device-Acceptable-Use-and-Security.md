# **Definitions**

**Clear text**: Unencrypted data

**Full disk encryption**: Technique that encrypts an entire hard drive, including operating system and data.

**Key**: Phrase used to encrypt or decrypt data

# **Overview**

Acceptable use of North Coast Church owned mobile devices must be managed to ensure that employees, Board of Directors, and related constituents who use mobile devices to access North Coast Church’s resources for business do so in a safe and secure manner.

This policy is designed to maximize the degree to which private and confidential data is protected from both deliberate and inadvertent exposure and/or breach.

**Purpose**

This policy defines the standards, procedures, and restrictions for end users who have legitimate business requirements to access corporate data from a mobile device connected to an unmanaged network outside of North Coast Church’s direct control.

This mobile device policy applies to, but is not limed to, any mobile device issued by North Coast Church that contains stored data owned by North Coast Church and all devices and accompanying media that fit the following device classifications:

- Laptops. Notebooks, and hybrid devices
- Tablets
- Mobile/cellular phones including smartphones
- Any North Coast Church owned mobile device capable of storing corporate data and connecting to an unmanaged network

This policy addresses a range of threats to, or related to, the use of North Coast Church data:

| **Threat** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Loss** | Devices used to transfer, or transport work files could be lost or stolen |
| **Theft** | Sensitive corporate data is deliberately stolen and sold by an employee |
| **Copyright** | Software copied onto a mobile device could violate licensing |
| **Malware** | Virus, Trojans, Worms, Spyware and other threats could be introduced via a mobile device |
| **Compliance** | Loss or theft of financial and/or personal and confidential data could expose North Coast Church to the risk of non-compliance with various identity theft and privacy laws |

Addition of new hardware, software, and/or related components to provide additional mobile device connectivity will be managed at the sole discretion of IT.

Non-sanctioned use of mobile devices to backup, store, and otherwise access any enterprise-related data is strictly forbidden.

This policy is complementary to any other implemented policies dealing specifically with data access, data storage, data movement, and connectivity of mobile devices to any element of the North Coast Church network.

**Audience**

This policy applies to all North Coast Church employees, including full and part-time staff, and the Board of Directors who utilize company-owned mobile devices to access, store, back up, relocate, or access any organization or member-specific data.

Such access to this confidential data is a privilege, not a right, and forms the basis of the trust North Coast Church has built with its members, suppliers, and other constituents.

Consequently, employment at North Coast Church does not automatically guarantee the initial and ongoing ability to use these devices to gain access to corporate networks and information.

## **Policy Detail**

This policy applies to any corporate owned hardware and related software that could be used to access corporate resources.

The overriding goal of this policy is to protect the integrity of the private and confidential member and business data that resides within North Coast Church’s technology infrastructure.

This policy intends to prevent this data from being deliberately or inadvertently stored insecurely on a mobile device or carried over an insecure network where it can potentially be accessed by unsanctioned resources.

A breach of this type could result in loss of information, damage to critical applications, loss of revenue, and damage to North Coast Church’s public image.

Therefore, all users employing a North Coast Church owned mobile device, connected to an unmanaged network outside of North Coast Church’s direct control, to backup, store, and otherwise access corporate data of any type must adhere to company-defined processes for doing so.

**Affected Technology**

Connectivity of all mobile devices will be centrally managed by North Coast Church’s IT Department and will utilize authentication and strong encryption measures. To protect North Coast Church’s infrastructure, failure to adhere to these security protocols will result in immediate suspension of all network access privileges.

**Responsibilities /R**

It is the responsibility of any employee or Board Member of North Coast Church, who uses a North Coast Church owned mobile device to access corporate resources, to ensure that all security protocols normally used in the management of data on conventional storage infrastructure are also applied here.

It is imperative that any North Coast Church owned mobile device that is used to conduct North Coast Church business be utilized appropriately, responsibly, and ethically. Failure to do so will result in immediate suspension of that user’s account. Based on this, the following rules must be observed:

- **Access Control**
  - IT reserves the right to refuse, by physical and non-physical means, the ability to connect mobile devices to North Coast Church and North Coast Church-connected infrastructure. IT will engage in such action if it feels such equipment is being used in such a way that puts North Coast Church’s systems, data, users, and members at risk.
  - Prior to initial use on the North Coast Church network or related infrastructure, **all mobile devices must be registered with IT**. North Coast Church will maintain a list of approved mobile devices and related software applications and utilities, and it will be stored in the IT Document Storage location. Devices that are not on this list may not be connected to the North Coast Church infrastructure. To find out if a preferred device is on this list, an individual should contact the North Coast Church IT Department Service Desk.
  - Although IT currently allows only listed devices to be connected to the North Coast Church infrastructure, it reserves the right to update this list in the future.
  - **End users** who wish to connect such devices to non-corporate network infrastructure to gain access to North Coast Church data **must employ**, for their devices and related infrastructure, **a company-approved personal firewall** and any other security measure deemed necessary by the IT Department. North Coast Church data is not to be accessed on any hardware that fails to meet North Coast Church’s established enterprise IT security standards.
  - All mobile devices attempting to connect to the North Coast Church network through an unmanaged network (i.e. the Internet) will be inspected using technology centrally managed by North Coast Church’s IT Department. Devices that are not corporate issued are not in compliance with IT’s security policies and will not be allowed to connect except by provision of the Personal Device Acceptable Use and Security Policy. North Coast Church owned laptop computers may only access the corporate network and data using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) VPN connection. The SSL or IPSec VPN portal Web address will be provided to users as required. Smart mobile devices such as Smartphones, PDAs, and UMPCs will access the North Coast Church network and data using Mobile VPN software installed on the device by IT.
- **Security /R**
  - **Employees** using mobile devices and related software for network and data access **will**, without exception, **use secure data management procedures**. All mobile devices containing stored data owned by North Coast Church **must use an approved method of encryption** to protect data. Laptops must employ full drive encryption with an approved software encryption package. No North Coast Church data may exist on a laptop in clear text. All mobile devices must be protected by a **strong password**. Refer to the North Coast Church password policy for additional information. **Employees agree to never disclose their passwords to anyone**, particularly to family members, if business work is conducted from home.
  - All keys used for encryption and decryption must meet complexity requirements described in North Coast Church’s Password Policy.
  - All users of corporate owned mobile devices must employ reasonable physical security measures. End users are expected to secure all such devices used for this activity whether they are actually in use and/or being carried. This includes, but is not limited to, passwords, encryption, and physical control of such devices whenever they contain North Coast Church data. Users with devices that are not issued by North Coast Church must adhere to the Personal Device Acceptable Use and Security Policy.
  - To ensure the security of North Coast Church equipment, mobile devices will be transported and stored as specified in the “Mobile Device Transport and Storage” procedure.
  - Passwords and confidential data should not be stored on unapproved or unauthorized non-North Coast Church devices.
  - Any corporate owned mobile device that is being used to store North Coast Church data must adhere to the authentication requirements of North Coast Church’s IT Department. In addition, all hardware security configurations must be pre- approved by North Coast Church’s IT Department before any enterprise data-carrying device can be connected to it.
  - IT will manage security policies, network, application, and data access centrally using whatever technology solutions it deems suitable. Any attempt to contravene or bypass said security implementation will be deemed an intrusion attempt and will be dealt with in accordance with North Coast Church’s overarching security policy.
  - Employees, Board of Directors, and temporary staff will follow all enterprise- sanctioned data removal procedures to permanently erase company- specific data from such devices once their use is no longer required. For assistance with detailed data wipe procedures for mobile devices, an individual should contact the North Coast Church IT Department Service Desk. This information is found in the IT Document Storage location.
  - In the event of a lost or stolen mobile device, it is incumbent on the user to report this to IT immediately. North Coast Church shall employ remote wipe technology to remotely disable and delete any data stored on a North Coast Church PDA or cell phone that is reported lost or stolen. If the device is recovered, it can be submitted to IT for re-provisioning.
  - Usage of location-based services and mobile check-in services, which leverage device GPS capabilities to share real-time user location with external parties, is prohibited within the workplace. This applies to both North Coast Church-owned and personal mobile devices being used within North Coast Church’s premises.
  - IT maintains the process for patching and updating mobile devices. A device’s firmware/operating system must be up-to-date in order to prevent vulnerabilities and make the device more stable. The patching and updating processes are the responsibility of IT for computing platforms (i.e. laptops). /R
  - IT maintains the process for security audits on mobile devices. Since handheld devices are not completely under the control of North Coast Church, a periodic audit will be performed to ensure the devices are not a potential threat to North Coast Church.
- **Help and Support**
  - North Coast Church’s IT Department will support its sanctioned hardware and software but is not accountable for conflicts or problems caused by the use of unsanctioned media, hardware, or software. This applies even to devices already known to the IT Department.
  - Employees, Board of Directors, and temporary staff will not make modifications of any kind to North Coast Church owned and installed hardware or software without the express approval of North Coast Church’s IT Department. This includes, but is not limited to, any reconfiguration of the mobile device.
  - IT reserves the right, through policy enforcement and any other means it deems necessary, to limit the ability of end users to transfer data to and from specific resources on the North Coast Church network.
- **Organizational Protocol**
  - IT can and will establish audit trails and these will be accessed, published, and used without notice. Such trails will be able to track the attachment of an external device to a PC, and the resulting reports may be used for investigation of possible breaches and/or misuse. To identify unusual usage patterns or other suspicious activity, the end user agrees to and accepts that his or her access and/or connection to North Coast Church’s networks may be monitored to record dates, times, duration of access, etc. This is done to identify accounts/computers that may have been compromised by external parties. In all cases, data protection remains North Coast Church’s highest priority.
  - The end user agrees to immediately report, to his/her manager and North Coast Church’s IT Department, any incident or suspected incidents of unauthorized data access, data loss, and/or disclosure of North Coast Church resources, databases, networks, etc.
  - North Coast Church will not reimburse employees if they choose to purchase their own mobile devices except in accordance with the Personal Device Acceptable Use and Security Policy. Users will not be allowed to expense mobile network usage costs.
  - North Coast Church prohibits the unsafe and unlawful use of mobile devices, including but not limited to, texting, emailing, or any distracting activity while driving, and requires this audience to comply with all state laws in which one is currently operating, regarding same, hands-free requirements, etc.
  - Before being granted a device and access to North Coast Church resources, a mobile device user must understand and accept the terms and conditions of this policy.
