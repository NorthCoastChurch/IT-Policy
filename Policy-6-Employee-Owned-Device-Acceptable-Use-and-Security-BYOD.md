# Employee Owned Device Acceptable Use and Security BYOD

# **Definitions**

**Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):** Privately owned wireless and/or portable electronic handheld equipment.

# **Overview**

Acceptable use of BYOD at North Coast Church must be managed to ensure that access to North Coast Church’s resources for business are performed in a safe and secure manner for participants of the North Coast Church BYOD program. A participant of the BYOD program includes, but is not limited to:

- Employees
- Contractors
- Volunteers
- Related constituents who participate in the BYOD program

This policy is designed to maximize the degree to which private and confidential data is protected from both deliberate and inadvertent exposure and/or breach.

**Purpose**

This policy defines the standards, procedures, and restrictions for end users who have legitimate business requirements to access corporate data using their personal device. This policy applies to, but is not limited to, any mobile devices owned by any users listed above participating in the North Coast Church BYOD program which contains stored data owned by North Coast Church, and all devices and accompanying media that fit the following device classifications:

- Laptops. Notebooks, and hybrid devices
- Tablets
- Mobile/cellular phones including smartphones
- Any non-North Coast Church owned mobile device capable of storing corporate data and connecting to an unmanaged network or managed devices

This policy addresses a range of threats to, or related to, the use of North Coast Church data:

| **Threat** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Loss | Devices used to transfer, or transport work files could be lost or stolen |
| Theft | Sensitive corporate data is deliberately stolen and sold by an employee |
| Copyright | Software copied onto a mobile device could violate licensing |
| Malware | Virus, Trojans, Worms, Spyware and other threats could be introduced via a mobile device |
| Compliance | Loss or theft of financial and/or personal and confidential data could expose North Coast Church to the risk of non-compliance with various identity theft and privacy laws |

Addition of new hardware, software, and/or related components to provide additional mobile device connectivity will be managed at the sole discretion of IT. Non-sanctioned use of mobile devices to backup, store, and otherwise access any enterprise-related data is strictly forbidden.

This policy is complementary to any other implemented policies dealing specifically with data access, data storage, data movement, and connectivity of mobile devices to any element of the North Coast Church network.

**Audience**

This policy applies to all North Coast Church employees, including full and part-time staff, volunteers, contractors, freelancers, and other agents who utilize personally-owned unmanaged devices to access, store, back up, relocate, or access any organization or member-specific data. Such access to this confidential data is a privilege, not a right, and forms the basis of the trust North Coast Church has built with its members, suppliers, and other constituents. Consequently, employment at North Coast Church does not automatically guarantee the initial and ongoing ability to use these devices to gain access to corporate networks and information.

## **Policy Detail**

This policy applies to:

- Any privately owned wireless and/or portable electronic equipment, hereby referred to as BYOD.
- Related software that could be used to access corporate resources.

This policy is intended to protect the security and integrity of North Coast Church’s data and technology infrastructure. Limited exceptions to the policy may occur due to variations in devices and platforms.

The Audience, as defined above, must agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy to be able to connect their devices to the company network. If users do not abide by this policy, North Coast Church reserves the right to revoke this privilege.

The following criteria will be considered initially, and on a continuing basis, to determine if the Audience is eligible to connect a personal smart device to the North Coast Church network.

- Management’s written permission and certification of the need and efficacy of BYOD for that Employee
- Sensitivity of data the Audience can access
- Legislation or regulations prohibiting or limiting the use of a personal smart device for North Coast Church business
- Must be listed on the Information Technology Department’s list of approved mobile devices
- Audience’s adherence to the terms of the Bring Your Own Device Agreement and this policy and other applicable policies

**Responsibilities of North Coast Church**

- IT will centrally manage the BYOD program and devices including, but not limited to, monitoring BYOD connections, and terminating BYOD connections to company resources upon the users leave of employment or service to North Coast Church.
- IT will manage security policies, network, application, and access centrally using whatever technology solutions it deems suitable.
- IT reserves the right to refuse the ability to connect mobile devices to North Coast Church and North Coast Church-connected infrastructure. IT will engage in such action if it feels such equipment is being used in such a way that puts North Coast Church’s systems, data, users, and members at risk.
- IT will maintain a list of approved mobile devices and related software applications and utilities. Devices that are not on this list may not be connected to the North Coast Church infrastructure. To find out if a preferred device is on this list, an individual should contact the North Coast Church IT Service Desk. Although IT currently allows only listed devices to be connected to the North Coast Church infrastructure, IT reserves the right to update this list in the future.
- IT will maintain enterprise IT security standards.
- IT will inspect all mobile devices attempting to connect to the North Coast Church network through an unmanaged network (i.e. the Internet) using technology centrally managed by the IT Department.

**North Coast Church’s IT Department reserves the right to:**

- Install anti-virus software on applicable BYOD participating devices
- Restrict unapproved applications from accessing enterprise data
- Limit use of network resources
- Wipe data on lost/damaged devices or upon termination from the BYOD program or North Coast Church employment
- Properly perform job provisioning and configuration of BYOD participating equipment before connecting to the network

**Responsibilities of BYOD Participants Security and Damages**

- All potential participants will be granted access to the North Coast Church network on the condition that they read, sign, respect, and adhere to the North Coast Church policies concerning the use of these devices and services (see Exhibit A).
- Prior to initial use on the North Coast Church network or related infrastructure, all personally owned mobile devices must be registered with IT.
- Participants of the BYOD program and related software for network and data access will, without exception:
  - Use secure data management procedures. All BYOD equipment, containing stored data owned by North Coast Church, must use an approved method of encryption during transmission to protect data.
  - Be expected to adhere to the same security protocols when connected with approved BYOD equipment to protect North Coast Church’s infrastructure.
- North Coast Church data is not to be accessed on any hardware that fails to meet North Coast Church’s established enterprise IT security standards.
  - Ensure that all security protocols normally used in the management of data on conventional storage infrastructure are also applied to BYOD use.
  - Utilize a device lock with authentication, such as biometric or strong password, on each participating device. Refer to the North Coast Church password policy for additional information.
  - Employees agree to never disclose their passwords to anyone, particularly to family members, if business work is conducted from home.
  - Passwords and confidential data should not be stored on unapproved or unauthorized non-North Coast Church devices, services or applications.
  - Exercise reasonable physical security measures. It is the end users responsibility to keep their approved BYOD equipment safe and secure.
  - A device’s firmware/operating system must be up-to-date in order to prevent vulnerabilities and make the device more stable. The patching and updating processes are the responsibility of the owner.
  - Any non-corporate computers used to synchronize with BYOD equipment will have installed anti-virus and anti-malware software deemed necessary by North Coast Church’s IT Department. Anti-virus signature files must be up to date on any additional client machines – such as a home PC – on which this media will be accessed.
  - IT can and will establish audit trails and these will be accessed, published, and used without notice. Such trails will be able to track the attachment of an external device to a PC, and the resulting reports may be used for investigation of possible breaches and/or misuse.
  - If A) any BYOD device is lost or stolen, immediately contact North Coast Church IT; and, if B) When upgrading or exchanging BYOD devices connected to North Coast Church Resources, the user must contact IT in advance. IT will disable the BYOD and delete associated company data.
  - BYOD equipment that is used to conduct North Coast Church business will be utilized appropriately, responsibly, and ethically. Failure to do so will result in immediate suspension of that user’s access.
  - Any attempt to contravene or bypass said security implementation will be deemed an intrusion attempt and will be dealt with in accordance with North Coast Church’s overarching security policy.
  - The user agrees to and accepts that his or her access and/or connection to North Coast Church’s networks may be monitored to record dates, times, duration of access, etc. This is done to identify unusual usage patterns or other suspicious activity, and to identify accounts/computers that may have been compromised. In all cases, data protection remains North Coast Church’s highest priority.
  - Employees, volunteers, contractors, and temporary staff will not reconfigure mobile devices with any type of North Coast Church owned data or installed software without the express approval of North Coast Church’s IT Department.
  - The end user agrees to immediately report, to his/her manager and North Coast Church’s IT Department, any incident or suspected incidents of unauthorized data access, data loss, and/or disclosure of North Coast Church resources, databases, networks, etc.
