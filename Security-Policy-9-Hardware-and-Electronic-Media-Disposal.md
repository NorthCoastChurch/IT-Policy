Hardware and electronic media disposition is necessary at {COMPANY-NAME} to ensure the proper disposition of all non-leased {COMPANY-NAME} IT hardware and media capable of storing member information.

This policy will establish and define standards, procedures, and restrictions for the disposition of non-leased IT equipment and media in a legal, cost-effective manner.

{COMPANY-NAME}’s surplus or obsolete IT assets and resources (i.e. desktop computers, servers, etc.) must be discarded according to legal requirements and environmental regulations through the appropriate external agents and {COMPANY-NAME}’s upgrade guidelines.

All disposition procedures for retired IT assets must adhere to company approved methods.
