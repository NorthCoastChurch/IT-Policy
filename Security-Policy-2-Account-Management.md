## **Policy Detail**

**Accounts**

- All default passwords for accounts must be constructed in accordance with the {COMPANY-NAME} Password Policy.
- All accounts must have a password expiration that complies with the {COMPANY-NAME} Password Policy.
- Concurrent connections may be limited for technical or security reasons.
- All accounts must be disabled immediately upon notification of any employee’s termination.

**Account Management**

The following items apply to System Administrators or designated staff:

- Information system user accounts are to be constructed so that they enforce the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses required for the performance of tasks associated with an individual’s account. Further, to eliminate conflicts of interest, accounts shall be created so that no one user can authorize, perform, review, and audit a single transaction.
- All information system accounts will be actively managed. Active management includes the acts of establishing, activating, modifying, disabling, and removing accounts from information systems.
- Access controls will be determined by following established procedures for new employees, employee changes, employee terminations, and leave of absence.
- All account modifications must have a documented process to modify a user account to accommodate situations such as name changes and permission changes.
- Information system accounts are to be reviewed monthly to identify inactive accounts. If an employee or third party account is found to be inactive for 30 days, the owners (of the account) and their manager will be notified of pending disablement. If the account continues to remain inactive for 15 days, it will be manually disabled.
- A list of accounts, for the systems they administer, must be provided when requested by authorized {COMPANY-NAME} management.
- An independent audit review may be performed to ensure the accounts are properly managed.
